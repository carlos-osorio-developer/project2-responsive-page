# Project Name: The Next Website Clone

## Week 2 - Collaborative Project [Responsive Website Design]

This is a collaborative project of Microverse, to build fully responsive page based on this  site:

[Live Demo clone site](https://perma.cc/M5ZV-Q2D6)

This project was created as a clone of the Next Website . In this exercise, responsive design techniques are applied in order for the website to change the content disposal according to the size of the screen where the website is displayed.

A mobile-first approach is used: The page is designed for the mobile version first and then the mediaqueries are created for the tablet and desktop versions.

This is the second project for Microverse.
The collaborative Coding experience was an amazing experience, spending time and holding each other accountable  to learn and  create this project from ground was fun. I was sure to complete the project and understand every bits in details.
